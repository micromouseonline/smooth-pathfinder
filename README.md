Creating a smooth, continuous path for a micromouse using a state machine

This is a complete application that illustrates the use of the smooth micromouse path generator.

For a description of the state machine look here:

Test data consists of pairs of input and output sequences. The input sequence is a string and the output sequence is a set of commands that can be executed by the micromouse.

The code was developed step-by-step. Each step consisted of writing a test data pair and then modifying the code until the generated output matched the expected output in the test data pair.
